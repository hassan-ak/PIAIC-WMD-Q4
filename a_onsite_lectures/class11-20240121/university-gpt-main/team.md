Junaid From Lahore:

Alhamdulillah sir deployed full ToDo fastapi microservice and nextjs frontend on vercel:

Vercel Deployment:

https://cax.vercel.app/

In Fastapi we have same layered architecture (web, service, data, tests) & tests (unit + e2e). And on frontend we are now dynamic at the speed of static. (All requests are force-cached and revalidated on each action).

In todo project vercel deployment students may face these errors:

a. A Serverless Function has exceeded the unzipped maximum size of 250 MB
Workaround: Remove ".next" and redeploy.

b. No more than 12 Serverless Functions can be added to a Deployment on the Hobby plan.
Workaround: In the api folder add "_" prefix with all python files except for fastapi main file.  Else each py file counts as a serverless function.

•⁠  ⁠For vercel deployment the python version is 3.9 but it didn't cause any issue just typing update (using Union instead of '|').
